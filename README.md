# 🧠 Learning Through Research  — My Personal Research Workspace

Welcome to my **Learning-Through-Research**, where I collect and summarize the research papers I study across my main subjects:
- Advanced Artificial Intelligence
- Machine Learning
- Internet of Things (IoT)
- Advanced Cryptography

This project is inspired by my senior’s research corpus.  
The goal is to **develop a habit of reading research papers**, writing summaries, and connecting ideas across different domains.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Build my own digital library of research papers.
- Understand the key algorithms and ideas from each domain.
- Prepare summaries for future research projects, hackathons, and thesis writing.
